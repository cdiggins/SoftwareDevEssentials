# SoftwareDevEssentials

**An open guide to the essential skills every professional software developer should master.**

## 📌 Why This Exists

Today, it’s easier than ever to build working software — tutorials, frameworks, and tools have lowered the bar for entry. That’s a good thing.

But it also means that **many developers enter the industry with critical gaps in their knowledge**. They may not realize what skills are expected of them in a professional environment — until they're already on the job.

This isn’t just a challenge for self-taught developers.

Even students pursuing Computer Science degrees often graduate **without exposure to practical software development**, system design, or modern tooling workflows. Others may be experts in one niche but unaware of foundational skills expected in others.
